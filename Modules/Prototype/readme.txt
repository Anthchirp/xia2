Modules/Prototypes
------------------

This directory will hold prototype interfaces for all modules. The prototype
interfaces should be inherited from in the implementation of the modules - 
to allow tracking of the implementations available.

At some stage I will need to implement a mechanism which will allow selection
from the available implementations.

4/SEP/06 - this is now moved to Schema/Interfaces from here. This directory
needs to be removed.
