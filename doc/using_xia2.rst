Using xia2
++++++++++

As mentioned in the :doc:`quick start guide </quick_start>`, to get started simply run::

  xia2 -2d /here/are/my/images

or::

  xia2 -3d /here/are/my/images

The program is used from the command-line; there is no GUI. The four
most important command-line options are as follows:

  =======  =====
  Option   Usage
  =======  =====
  -atom X  tell xia2 to separate anomalous pairs i.e. I(+) 6= I(âˆ’) in scaling
  -2d      tell xia2 to use MOSFLM_ and Aimless_
  -3d      tell xia2 to use XDS_ and XSCALE_
  -3dii    tell xia2 to use XDS_ and XSCALE_, indexing with peaks found from all images
  -dials   tell xia2 to use DIALS_ and Aimless_
  =======  =====

These specify in the broadest possible terms to the program the manner
in which you would like the processing performed. The program will then
read all of the image headers found in :samp:`/here/are/my/data` to organise the
data, first into sweeps, then into wavelengths, before assigning all of these
wavelengths to a crystal.

The data from the experiment is understood as follows. The SWEEP,
which corresponds to one "scan", is the basic unit of indexing and integration.
These are contained by WAVELENGTH objects which correspond to
CCP4 MTZ datasets, and will ultimately have unique Miller indices. For
example, a low and high dose pass will be merged together. A CRYSTAL
however contains all of the data from the experiment and is the basic unit of
data for scaling. This description of the experiment is written automatically
to an instruction file, an example of which is shown in Figure 1.
