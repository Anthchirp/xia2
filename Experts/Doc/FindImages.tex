\section{Introduction}

This module will provide expertise for finding diffraction images in a
directory. 

\subsection{Glossary}

The following exact terms will be used in this document.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Template - a string which represents the names for a sequence of
diffraction images, like \verb|foo_bar_1_####.img|. The \verb|###| will
be replaced with a sequence of three-digit numbers.}
\item{Directory - the location of these files.}
\item{Prefix, Extension - - strings representing the two halfs of the 
template around \verb|###.| e.g. foo\_bar\_1 and img above.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Cases}

\subsection{UC 1: Derive Template and Directory from Image Name}

Action: Derive from a (full path) image name, return a likely template and
directory for these files. 

Function: image2template\_directory(image), image2template(image)

\subsection{UC 2: Finding Images from Template and Directory}

Action: a template and directory are provided. This directory is searched for
files which have a matching name, and the list of matching image numbers 
returned as a sorted list of integers.

Function: find\_matching\_images(template, directory)

\subsection{UC 3: Constructing Full Path}

When provided with a template, directory and image, construct the full path
to the image.

Function: template\_directory\_number2image(template, directory, number)

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{UC 1}

This will use the following regular expression to match the image name:

{
\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
(.*)_([0-9]*)\.(.*)
\end{verbatim}
}

which means (whatever) (underscore) (some digits) (dot) (whatever). This will
not match files called foo001.img or foo.001 etc. Is this a problem?? Look 
in to this - could the (underscore) and (dot) be optional? Should be doable.
Adding ? after the offending tokens could do it - add this to the unit test.
This would make the expression:

{
\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
(.*)_?([0-9]*)\.?(.*)?
\end{verbatim}
}

Oh - this et's stuck on the greediness of things - better off trying to 
match a number of patterns in sequence and see which works best... Yes, this
works though it makes for notty code, including dictionarys of how to put
the template back together. I ended up with:

{
\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
def image2template(filename):
    '''Return a template to match this filename.'''

    # the patterns in the order I want to test them

    pattern_keys = [r'(.*)_([0-9]*)\.(.*)',
                    r'([^\.]*)\.([0-9]+)',
                    r'(.*?)([0-9]*)\.(.*)']

    # patterns is a dictionary of possible regular expressions with
    # the format strings to put the file name back together

    patterns = {r'(.*)_([0-9]*)\.(.*)':'%s_%s.%s',
                r'([^\.]*)\.([0-9]+)':'%s.%s%s',
                r'(.*?)([0-9]*)\.(.*)':'%s%s.%s'}

    for pattern in pattern_keys:
        match = re.compile(pattern).match(filename)

        if match:
            prefix = match.group(1)
            number = match.group(2)
            try:
                exten = match.group(3)
            except:
                exten = ''

            for digit in string.digits:
                number = number.replace(digit, '#')
                
            return patterns[pattern] % (prefix, number, exten)

    raise RuntimeError, 'filename %s not understood as a template' % \
          filename
\end{verbatim}
}

Still - it works!

\subsection{UC 2, 3}

Implemented.
