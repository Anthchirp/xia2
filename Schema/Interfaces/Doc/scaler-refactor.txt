Notes when refactoring scalers.
-------------------------------

Would be useful to have a standard mediator class which could contain and 
cache the information from the integraters (and hold the adjustments, e.g.
from rebatching)

This should be used directly by the scaler interface, which should also make
standard much of the common code from the ccp4 scaler and the xds one, for 
things like deciding on the standard indexing origin etc.
