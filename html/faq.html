    <h1>xia2: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h3>Will there be a GUI?</h3>

    <p>A CCP4i interface for xia2 is in development.</p>

    <h3>How long does it take?</h3>

    <p>Because xia2 is quite thorough in the data reduction, it can take
      a little while and also appear to be doing the same thing over and 
      over again, for instance integrating a particular sweep. However,
      by it's design each of these jobs is required, and should be making
      the results better. For my test cases, which are reasonably typical
      MAD, SAD and native data sets, anywhere between 30 minutes and four
      hours is typical - however this depends greatly on the computer, where 
      the data are stored.

    <h3>What about directories with spaces in?</h3>

    <p>Working from directories with spaces in the path, or in directories
      with spaces in the name may cause problems - generally it is a 
      good idea to avoid this if possible. This is a particular problem 
      on Windows where things like to live in "Documents and Settings".</p>

    <p>Reducing data from directories with spaces in can have unpredictable
      consequences - often it will work, sometimes it won't, and in those
      timetimes the errors can be cryptic!</p>

    <h3>What detector types are supported?</h3>

    <p>Currently I actively support:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ADSC CCD detectors</li>
      <li>MAR CCD detectors</li>
      <li>MAR image plate detectors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>and I think that RAXIS IV image plate detectors work as well - however
      I do not have data to routinely test against. If you have a different
      detector you would like supporting (which writes out <i>corrected</i>
      images, please get in touch - ideally with a test data set of insulin
      or lysozyme for me to work with.</p>

    <h3>Scaling 180 degrees of cubic inculin fails - why?</h3>

    <p>Unfortunately xia2 reads the loggraph output from Scala - which 
      cannot cope with a Mn(I)/sigma > 99.99 - which highly redundant cubic 
      insulin data often has. I am working on a fix for this, however, the
      "best" solution is to fix the offending format statement in Scala, 
      and a patch has been submitted.</p>

    <h3>Why does it do so many redundant reindexing jobs?</h3>

    <p>Basically because I haven't got around to coding the switches
      to see if the reindexing operator is h,k,l and the input and
      output spacegroup records are identical - this will happen shortly
      though which should reduce the time taken for large data sets.</p>
