    <h1>xia2: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h3>Will there be a GUI?</h3>

    <p>A CCP4i interface for xia2 is in development.</p>

    <h3>What about directories with spaces in?</h3>

    <p>Working from directories with spaces in the path, or in directories
      with spaces in the name may cause problems - generally it is a 
      good idea to avoid this if possible. This is a particular problem 
      on Windows where things like to live in "Documents and Settings".</p>

    <p>Reducing data from directories with spaces in can have unpredictable
      consequences - often it will work, sometimes it won't, and in those
      timetimes the errors can be cryptic!</p>

    <h3>What detector types are supported?</h3>

    <p>Currently I actively support:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ADSC CCD detectors</li>
      <li>MAR CCD detectors</li>
      <li>MAR image plate detectors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>and I think that RAXIS IV image plate detectors work as well - however
      I do not have data to routinely test against. If you have a different
      detector you would like supporting (which writes out <i>corrected</i>
      images, please get in touch - ideally with a test data set of insulin
      or lysozyme for me to work with.</p>

    <h3>Scaling 180 degrees of cubic inculin fails - why?</h3>

    <p>Unfortunately xia2 reads the loggraph output from Scala - which 
      cannot cope with a Mn(I)/sigma > 99.99 - which highly redundant cubic 
      insulin data often has. I am working on a fix for this, however, the
      "best" solution is to fix the offending format statement in Scala, 
      and a patch has been submitted.</p>
