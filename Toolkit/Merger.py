# A toolkit component for merging symmetry related intensity measurements
# to calculate:
# 
#  - Rmerge vs. batch, resolution
#  - Chi^2
#  - Multiplicity
#  - Unmerged I/sigma
# 
# Then in a separate calculation, E^4, merged I/sigma and completeness will
# be calculated. This should be a different Toolkit component.
