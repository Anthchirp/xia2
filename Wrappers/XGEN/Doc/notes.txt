This is how you run XGEN in the simplest case, to reduce the data for the
1VPJ/12287 test case... there are still issues and this is not 100% yet!


#!/bin/bash
xgen xgnow ../12287_1_E1_001.img
. 12287_1_E1_.com
xgen calibrate -j 1064 1028
xgen spots -e0.12
xgen refall -i89
xgen integrate -e0.12
xgen reduce
xgen scale
xgen scalem

xgen xgnow ../12287_1_E2_001.img
. 12287_1_E2_.com
xgen calibrate -j 1064 1028
xgen spots -e0.12
xgen refall -i89
xgen integrate -e0.12
xgen reduce
xgen scale
xgen scalem

This will be another case of having different wrappers for each program, 
with a unified wrapper for the whole to provide the Indexer and Integrater
interfaces...

From calibrate.txt... look up the description of the beam centre in xcen, ycen.
