# A wrapper for the model building and refinement program Arp/wArp -
# in terms of the license agreement (which follows below) this is called
# the XIA2 PIPELINE.
# 
# Dear Graeme,
# 
# We are happy to let you know that we give a permission to invoke
# ARP/wARP for model building into the XIA2 pipeline, under a few conditions.
# 
# Hereafter a part of the XIA2 software that invokes ARP/wARP as the only
# model building module is called XIA2 PIPELINE.
# 
# 1. This agreement does not grant a license to ARP/wARP. The distribution
# of ARP/wARP with XIA2 PIPELINE is not permitted.
# 
# 2. Permission is only granted for a use of XIA2 PIPELINE, excluding any
# redistribution or sub-licensing.
# 
# 3. Prior to the use of XIA2 PIPELINE academic users will be required to
# obtain an ARP/wARP license and the software suite package from the web
# site www.arp-warp.org; commercial users will be required to agree to
# take a commercial license on the current ARP/wARP version from EMBL
# Enterprise Management Technology Transfer GmbH (EMBLEM), Heidelberg,
# Germany.
# 
# 4. The XIA2 PIPELINE will check the version of ARP/wARP in the user’s
# environment and all current releases of XIA2 PIPELINE will work only
# with the current version of ARP/wARP. In case when ARP/wARP is not
# installed on the system, XIA2 PIPELINE will direct the user to ARP/wARP
# web site.
# 
# 5. XIA2 PIPELINE interface and log files should have clear information
# for users that any use of ARP/wARP requires appropriate citation and
# this will be as printed in the ARP/wARP log file. Moreover, should you
# develop any automatic submission tools of projects details to the PDB,
# these should also contain proper citation of the use of ARP/wARP.
# 
# We hope that you agree to the conditions of this permission and we would
# appreciate receiving a statement from you.
# 
# You are welcome to contact us if you need advice on how ARP/wARP modules
# could best be invoked from XIA2 PIPELINE. We look forward to fruitful
# cooperation between the ARP/wARP and the XIA2 PIPELINE authors.
# 
# With best regards,
# Victor and Tassos
