\section{Introduction}

This document describes the use cases and API's for the program Mosflm.
Mosflm is an unusual case, because there are number of significant 
functions it performs - each of these will have to be a well identified 
use case.

\subsection{Functionality}

The program mosflm has the following key pieces of functionality which need 
to be exposed \emph{via} the API:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Autoindexing of diffraction patterns.}
\item{Estimation of mosaic spread.}
\item{Refinement of unit cell.}
\item{Integration of diffraction patterns.}
\item{Calculation of data collection strategies (deprecated.)}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Input}

Each of these tasks requires a certain amount of common input - it can only 
make sense to standardise on the API for this. Of particular importance
are the content of the image header and the frames to use in processing.
