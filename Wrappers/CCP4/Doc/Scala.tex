\section{Introduction}

This describes a Python program wrapper for the CCP4 Program Scala
(Evans, P ``Data Reduction'' in Proceedings of 1993 CCP4 Study Weekend.)
This wrapper provides most of the commonly used functionality implemented
in Scala.

\section{Use Cases}

\subsection{Simple 1: Scale and Merge Data}

The simplest implementation of the Scala wrapper is to simply take data 
from Mosflm and merge to a ``standard'' mtz file. This will need to perform
the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Apply a resolution limit.}
\item{Apply a scaling model.}
\item{Apply an error model.}
\item{Add project, crystal, dataset information.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simple 2: Just Merge}

This implementation would take data previously scaled by an outside program
(for instance XSCALE; SCALEPACK) and merge the reflections to provide
scaling statistics and a merged reflection file. This will need to provide
the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Apply a resolution limit.}
\item{Add project, crystal, dataset information.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{More Complex 1: Merging Data, 2 Passes}

Two datasets processed with Mosflm, appropriately REBATCHED and SORTED. The
resulting MTZ file will need to be scaled and merged appropriately to give
reasonable merging statistics from the two or more runs. This will require:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Apply resolution limits.}
\item{Apply a scaling model.}
\item{Apply error models per run.}
\item{Add project, crystal, dataset information.}
\end{itemize}

The error models are best decided by scaling the data separately then 
recycling the parameters.

\subsection{More Complex 2: Scaling MAD Data}

More than one data sets collected from the same crystal but at different 
wavelengths. The data will need to be scaled separately but used together
for building the absorption model etc. This is much more complex.

This will produce a number of output reflection files.

This will further need the reflections to be appropriately sorted and 
merged together in the file, with sensible project/crystal/dataset information
in advance of the processing.

FIXME this needs to be specified.
