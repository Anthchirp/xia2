Refactoring Mosflm Wrapper
--------------------------

Currently the wrapper Mosflm.py includes all sorts of things. In particular
there are two wrappers which are largely identical (Mosflm.py, MosflmR.py) 
which each contain functionality for:

 - indexing
 - selection of images
 - cell refinement
 - integration
 - testing lattices

And so on. It also inherits from Integrater, Indexer and FrameProcessor, 
which is messy. A much better idea would be to have a single wrapper class
Mosflm.py which does not expose any "standard" interfaces but instead has
methods for indexing, cell refinement &c. separately. This can then be wrapped
to produce MosflmIntegraters &c. as per the other packages.

Now, what would be good would be to try and generalise a little more - add
code which is relatively common to other classes (e.g. image selection) which 
can be inherited from provided that said class also inherits from #
FrameProcessor (say) so things like image headers are present. I need to 
be *absolutely* sure that there is no ambiguity in the inheritance.

Also:

#1020 Separate out spot finding and indexing

This will mean I can (i) avoid refinding spots to test the lattice and (ii) perhaps implement more potent indexing for e.g. microcrystal cases.

c/f Mosflm FINDSPOTS and AUTOINDEX keywords.

Should really implement a MosflmIndexerIIA for this as a separate MODULE which uses the Mosflm wrapper. May involve (and justifies) some redesigning.

Allocating to C7 with intention of looking at this next run.
