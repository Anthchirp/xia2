\section{Implementation of Data Processing with 
XDS}

\subsection{Introduction}

This document describes the implementation of the xia2 data processing 
interfaces (indexing, integration and scaling) with XDS. There are
two possibilities for this:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Processing with only XDS, XSCALE - that is, not assuming that pointless,
scala etc can be used.}
\item{Processing with XDS, XSCALE and CCP4 tools - this will probably be more
like the CCP4 Scaler implementation.}
\end{itemize}

Perhaps there should be two implementations...?

\subsection{Indexing}

\begin{verbatim}
xycorr -> init -> colspot -> idxref -> [select] -> idxref
\end{verbatim}

This will list all possible indexing solutions - the highest will be selected
for integration as per the current implementation with Mosflm.

\subsection{Integration 1}

\begin{verbatim}
defpix -> integrate [-> correct]
\end{verbatim}

This may recycle if the integration fails... for instance, I need to see how
the TS01 NATIVE is handled by XDS integrating in oI, when mC is correct.

\subsection{Pointgroup Determination}

\begin{verbatim}
integrate.hkl -> combat -> pointless -> [select indexing solution]
\end{verbatim}

This once again needs to be linked in to the indexer as per the 
CCP4 Scaler implementation. 

\subsection{Integration 2}

\begin{verbatim}
[select indexing solution] -> defpix -> integrate -> correct [in correct pg]
if fail, --spacegroup; repeat
\end{verbatim}

This may work out as being the same module as Integration 1, if it is
implemented in the same way as the CCP4 system.

\subsection{Reindexing \& Spacegroup Determination}

\begin{verbatim}
[sweep 1] -> [quick scale]
[n] * xds_ascii.hkl -> pointless [reindex against quick scale] -> correct
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Scaling \& Merging}

\begin{verbatim}
xscale [output unmerged] -> scala
\end{verbatim}

\end{document}
